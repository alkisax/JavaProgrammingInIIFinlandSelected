The exercise template contains a class Warehouse, which has the following constructors and methods:

public Warehouse(double capacity) - Creates an empty warehouse, which has the capacity provided as a parameter; an invalid capacity (<=0) creates a useless warehouse, with the the capacity 0.
public double getBalance() - Returns the balance of the warehouse, i.e. the capacity which is taken up by the items in the warehouse.
public double getCapacity() - Returns the total capacity of the warehouse (i.e. the one that was provided in the constructor).
public double howMuchSpaceLeft() - Returns a value telling how much space is left in the warehouse.
public void addToWarehouse(double amount) - Adds the desired amount to the warehouse; if the amount is negative, nothing changes, and if everything doesn't fit, then the warehouse is filled up and the rest is "thrown away" / "overflows".
public double takeFromWarehouse(double amount) - Take the desired amount from the warehouse. The method returns much we actually get. If the desired amount is negative, nothing changes and we return 0. If the desired amount is greater than the amount the warehouse contains, we get all there is to take and the warehouse is emptied.
public String toString() - Returns the state of the object represented as a string like this balance = 64.5, space left 123.5
In this exercise we build variations of a warehouse based on the Warehouse class.

Product warehouse, step 1
The class Warehouse handles the functions related to the amount of a product. Now we want a product name for the product and a way to handle the name. Let's write ProductWarehouse as a subclass of Warehouse! First, we'll just create a private object variable for the product name, a constructor, and a getter for the name field:

public ProductWarehouse(String productName, double capacity) - Creates an empty product warehouse. The name of the product and the capacity of the warehouse are provided as parameters.
public String getName() - Returns the name of the product.
Remind yourself of how a constructor can run the constructor of the superclass as its first action!

Example usage:

ProductWarehouse juice = new ProductWarehouse("Juice", 1000.0);
juice.addToWarehouse(1000.0);
juice.takeFromWarehouse(11.3);
System.out.println(juice.getName()); // Juice
System.out.println(juice);           // balance = 988.7, space left 11.3
Sample output
Juice
balance = 988.7, space left 11.3

Product warehouse, step 2
As we can see from the previous example, the toString() inherited by the ProductWarehouse object doesn't (obviously!) know anything about the product name. Something must be done! Let's also add a setter for the product name while we're at it:

public void setName(String newName) - sets a new name for the product.
public String toString() - Returns the state of the object represented as a string like this Juice: balance = 64.5, space left 123.5
The new toString() method could be written using the getters inherited from the superclass, which would give access to values of inherited, but still hidden fields. However, the superclass already has the desired functionality to provide a string representation of the warehouse state, so why bother recreating that functionality? Just take advantage of the inherited toString().

Remind yourself of how to call an overridden method in a subclass!

Usage example:

ProductWarehouse juice = new ProductWarehouse("Juice", 1000.0);
juice.addToWarehouse(1000.0);
juice.takeFromWarehouse(11.3);
System.out.println(juice.getName()); // Juice
juice.addToWarehouse(1.0);
System.out.println(juice);           // Juice: balance = 989.7, space left 10.299999999999955
Sample output
Juice
Juice: balance = 989.7, space left 10.299999999999955

Change History, step 1
Sometimes it might be useful to know how the inventory of a product changes over time: Is the inventory often low? Are we usually at the limit? Are the changes in inventory big or small? Etc. Thus we should give the ProductWarehouse class the ability to remember the changes in the amount of a product.

Let's begin by creating a tool that aids in the desired functionality.

The storing of the change history could of course have been done using an ArrayList<Double> object in the class ProductWarehouse, however, we want our own specialized tool for this purpose. The tool should be implemented by encapsulating the ArrayList<Double> object.

Public constructors and methods of the ChangeHistory class:

public ChangeHistory() creates an empty ChangeHistory object.
public void add(double status) adds provided status as the latest amount to remember in the change history.
public void clear() empties the history.
public String toString() returns the string representation of the change history. The string representation provided by the ArrayList class is sufficient.
Change History, step 2
Build on the ChangeHistory class by adding analysis methods:

public double maxValue() returns the largest value in the change history. If the history is empty, the method should return zero.
public double minValue() returns the smallest value in the change history. If the history is empty, the method should return zero.
public double average() returns the average of the values in the change history. If the history is empty, the method should return zero.
The methods should not modify the order of the encapsulated list.

Product warehouse with history, step 1
Implement ProductWarehouseWithHistory as a subclass of ProductWarehouse. In addition to all the previous features this new warehouse also provides services related to the change history of the warehouse inventory. The history is managed using the ChangeHistory object.

Public constructors and methods:

public ProductWarehouseWithHistory(String productName, double capacity, double initialBalance) creates a product warehouse. The product name, capacity, and initial balance are provided as parameters.
Set the initial balance as the initial balance of the warehouse, as well as the first value of the change history.

public String history() returns the product history like this [0.0, 119.2, 21.2]. Use the string representation of the ChangeHistory object as is.
NB in this initial version the history is not yet working properly; currently it only remembers the initial balance.

Usage example:

// the usual:
ProductWarehouseWithHistory juice = new ProductWarehouseWithHistory("Juice", 1000.0, 1000.0);
juice.takeFromWarehouse(11.3);
System.out.println(juice.getName()); // Juice
juice.addToWarehouse(1.0);
System.out.println(juice);           // Juice: balance = 989.7, space left 10.3

// etc

// however, history() still doesn't work properly:
System.out.println(juice.history()); // [1000.0]
// so we only get the initial state of the history set by the constructor...
Sample output

Juice
Juice: balance = 989.7, space left 10.299999999999955
[1000.0]
Product warehouse with history, step 2
It's time to make history! The first version didn't know anything but the initial state of the history. Expand the class with the following methods

public void addToWarehouse(double amount) works just like the method in the Warehouse class, but we also record the changed state to the history. NB: the value recorded in the history should be the warehouse's balance after adding, not the amount added!
public double takeFromWarehouse(double amount) works just like the method in the Warehouse class, but we also record the changed state to the history. NB: the value recorded in the history should be the warehouse's balance after removing, not the amount removed!
Usage example:

// the usual:
ProductWarehouseWithHistory juice = new ProductWarehouseWithHistory("Juice", 1000.0, 1000.0);
juice.takeFromWarehouse(11.3);
System.out.println(juice.getName()); // Juice
juice.addToWarehouse(1.0);
System.out.println(juice);           // Juice: balance = 989.7, space left 10.3

// etc

// and now we have the history:
System.out.println(juice.history()); // [1000.0, 988.7, 989.7]
Sample output

Juice
Juice: balance = 989.7, space left 10.299999999999955
[1000.0, 988.7, 989.7]
Remember how an overriding method can take advantage of the overridden method!

Product warehouse with history, step 3
Expand the class with the method

public void printAnalysis(), which prints history related information for the product in the way presented in the example.
Usage example:

ProductWarehouseWithHistory juice = new ProductWarehouseWithHistory("Juice", 1000.0, 1000.0);
juice.takeFromWarehouse(11.3);
juice.addToWarehouse(1.0);
//System.out.println(juice.history()); // [1000.0, 988.7, 989.7]

juice.printAnalysis();
Sample output
Product: Juice
History: [1000.0, 988.7, 989.7]
Largest amount of product: 1000.0
Smallest amount of product: 988.7
Average: 992.8






Abstract classes
Sometimes, when planning a hierarchy of inheritance, there are cases when there exists a clear concept, but that concept is not a good candidate for an object in itself. The concept would be beneficial from the point of view of inheritance, since it includes variables and functionality that are shared by all the classes that would inherit it. On the other hand, you should not be able to create instances of the concept itself.

An abstract class combines interfaces and inheritance. You cannot create instances of them â€” you can only create instances of subclasses of an abstract class. They can include normal methods which have a method body, but it's also possible to define abstract methods that only contain the method definition. Implementing the abstract methods is the responsibility of subclasses. Generally, abstract classes are used in situations where the concept that the class represents is not a clear independent concept. In such a case you shouldn't be able to create instances of it.

To define an abstract class or an abstract method the keyword abstract is used. An abstract class is defined with the phrase public abstract class *NameOfClass*; an abstract method is defined by public abstract returnType nameOfMethod. Let's take a look at the following abstract class called Operation, which offers a structure for operations and executing them.

public abstract class Operation {

    private String name;

    public Operation(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    public abstract void execute(Scanner scanner);
}
The abstract class Operation works as a basis for implementing different actions. For instance, you can implement the plus operation by extending the Operation class in the following manner.

public class PlusOperation extends Operation {

    public PlusOperation() {
        super("PlusOperation");
    }

    @Override
    public void execute(Scanner scanner) {
        System.out.print("First number: ");
        int first = Integer.valueOf(scanner.nextLine());
        System.out.print("Second number: ");
        int second = Integer.valueOf(scanner.nextLine());

        System.out.println("The sum of the numbers is " + (first + second));
    }
}
Since all the classes that inherit from Operation have also the type Operation, we can create a user interface by using Operation type variables. Next we'll show the class UserInterface that contains a list of operations and a scanner. It's possible to add operations to the UI dynamically.

public class UserInterface {

    private Scanner scanner;
    private ArrayList<Operation> operations;

    public UserInterface(Scanner scanner) {
        this.scanner = scanner;
        this.operations = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addOperation(Operation operation) {
        this.operations.add(operation);
    }

    public void start() {
        while (true) {
            printOperations();
            System.out.println("Choice: ");

            String choice = this.scanner.nextLine();
            if (choice.equals("0")) {
                break;
            }

            executeOperation(choice);
            System.out.println();
        }
    }

    private void printOperations() {
        System.out.println("\t0: Stop");
        int i = 0;
        while (i < this.operations.size()) {
            String operationName = this.operations.get(i).getName();
            System.out.println("\t" + (i + 1) + ": " + operationName);
            i = i + 1;
        }
    }

    private void executeOperation(String choice) {
        int operation = Integer.valueOf(choice);

        Operation chosen = this.operations.get(operation - 1);
        chosen.execute(scanner);
    }
}
The user interface works like this:

UserInterface userInterface = new UserInterface(new Scanner(System.in));
userInterface.addOperation(new PlusOperation());

userInterface.start();
Sample output
Operations:
0: Stop
1: PlusOperation
Choice: 1
First number: 8
Second number: 12
The sum of the numbers is 20

Operations:
0: Stop
1: PlusOperation
Choice: 0

The greatest difference between interfaces and abstract classes is that abstract classes can contain object variables and constructors in addition to methods. Since you can also define functionality in abstract classes, you can use them to define e.g. default behavior. In the user interface above storing the name of the operation used the functionality defined in the abstract Operation class.
